# Noisebridge Server Config

Add Noisebridge-related configuration files and such here!

This repo was originally created to store config files for our fancy
schmancy new (as of 2018.11.26) server
[Unicorn](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Unicorn).

If you wish to store your configuration-/installation-related files in
a more automatable form, considing creating `Dockerfile`s (also
welcome in this repo), or use Ansible and contribute your Ansible
roles to https://github.com/noisebridge/ansible .
